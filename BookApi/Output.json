Because these distributions are becoming more prominent in many applications, this book is a must for any serious researcher or consultant working in multivariate analysis and statistical distributions. Much of this material has never before appeared in book form. The first part of the book emphasizes theoretical results of a probabilistic nature. In the second part of the book, these are supplemented by a variety of statistical aspects. Various generalizations and applications are dealt with in the final chapters. The material on estimation and regression models is of special value for practitioners in statistics and economics. A comprehensive bibliography of over 350 references is included.",

They differ from conventional T cells not only in T cell receptor composition, but also in their development, tissue distribution, and physiological functions. This volume contains seven chapters contributed by experts on different aspects of T cells, including the natural ligands for T cell receptors, IL-7-dependent regulation of T cell development, cytokine-mediated inter-cellular communication of T cells with other cell types, and their physiological functions in innate and adaptive immune responses. The comprehensive review articles collected in this volume will be of interest to basic immunologists who wish to update their knowledge on the biology of T cells. The book also provides a unique opportunity for non-immunologists and clinicians to understand how the immune system is specifically equipped to protect the body against pathogens at the environmental interface.",

It provides detailed histories of the major players in the preservation battle including the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House, the American Film Institute, the Museum of Modern Art, the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and the Library of Congress. This first historical overview of film preservation in the United States is also highly controversial in its exposure and criticism of the politicization of film preservation in recent years, and the rising bureaucracy which has often lost sight of preservation and restoration as the ultimate purpose of film archives.",

    "description": "This book presents the state of the art in cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the immune response in allergic inflammation. Special attention is given to the central role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in immune regulation and induction of peripheral tolerance, as well as to the relevance of Th17 cells in chronic inflammation. The importance of Treg and Th17 cells is demonstrated in bronchial asthma, atopic eczema, contact dermatitis and delayed-type hypersensitivity. Furthermore, T-cell-mediated regulatory mechanisms in helminthic infections and fungal allergy are discussed. Several chapters are devoted to the therapeutic consequences that these recently discovered T-cell functions may have. Their role as a potential target for specific immunotherapy is evaluated and novel approaches for peripheral tolerance induction and treatment of allergic and asthmatic diseases and inflammation are suggested. Stem cell transplantation as a future therapeutic intervention in regulatory T-cell disorders is also considered. Well edited and up to date, this volume is recommended reading for allergologists, immunologists, dermatologists and any scientist interested in the immunological events regulating allergic inflammation in general and allergic manifestations in different organs.",

Kearse and a panel of laboratory experts describe the step-by-step execution of a wide variety of basic and specialized techniques for the study of T cell developmental biology and of their subsequent activation. Readily reproducible, the techniques are explained concisely, but in such detail that they are suitable for both the novice and experienced investigator. Coverage includes treatment of both fundamental and novel experimental protocols for the analysis of the role T cells play in immune function and in the prevention and cure of human diseases. Practical and timely, T Cell Protocols: Development and Activation offers basic scientists and clinical investigators a valuable compendium of key protocols that will improve skills with existing methods, as well as afford rapid mastery of powerful new techniques.",

    "description": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common and most severe form of inflammatory arthritis. The pathogenesis of RA has been the subject of intense research for several decades. The prevailing hypotheses have changed over the years, and have attempted to incorporate the most recent data. Although T cells represent an important component of the cells which infiltrate the joint synovium, their contribution at a late stage of the disease remains a matter of debate. The goal of this book is to outline the major arguments and data suggesting that T cells may, or may not, be central players in the pathogenesis of chronic RA. While each of the editors and authors has his/her own bias (as will be clear by reading the respective chapters), our hope is that the readers will enjoy a complete and balanced view of the critical questions and experiments. This is not just an intellectual exercise since the direction of future therapeutic interventions depends heavily on how one interprets the pathogenesis of RA and the contribution of T cells.",
